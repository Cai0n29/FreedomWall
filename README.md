FreedomWall - 
A website to say all the unsaid thoughts. The thoughts can also be posted and shared on the website (in progress improvement). It will be a board for all the thoughts that could've been said but left within our minds.
I made this projects to free the words trapped in our mind. And to let people voice opinions, emotions, and life experiences anonymously and often candidly.
Through React Js, I made this project into life
I faced new code topics in React and Javascript together with bugs that made a barrier to make this project possible. Though it's challeging, it helped me think outside of the box and solve this problems
